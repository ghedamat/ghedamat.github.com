Welcome!

### Short Bio

<img src="/assets/me.jpg" style="padding:0; max-width: 400px" />

How do you know someone is Italian? They tell you ðŸ¤Œ

I was born and raised in Italy and in my twenties I moved with my lifetime partner to Toronto, Canada.

After finishing my masters in Computer Engineer and working for a few years, the search for opportunities brought me to Spain, England and eventually landed me in Toronto. Everyone expected it to be another temporary stop but this time, before I knew, it I found myself at home ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.


### I'm a nerd for..

Self discovery, tech, coaching, hiking, travel and [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island).

Currently I work as CEO for [Art of Accomplishment](https://artofaccomplishment.com/).
Previously I was CTO at [Precision Nutrition](https://precisionnutrition.com), and before that I helped run [Unspace](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726132556/http://unspace.ca/).

I've spent a multitude of hours of my life meditating and doing theraphy/coaching/mentoring work. Both on the receiving and the giving ends. I had many mentors and teachers both in Italy and in North America. Some of my favorites that are easier to find online: [Shinzen Young](https://www.shinzen.org/), [Conscious Leadership Group](https://conscious.is/), [Hollow Bones Zen](https://hollowboneszen.org/), and [Art of Accomplishment](https://artofaccomplishment.com)

Most of my coding is done in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com/), and [Nix(OS)](https://nixos.org/) and I'm interested in most things programming.

**I love meetups**, over the years I have been organizing (with the help of some other amazing folks):

* [Toronto Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/TorontoElixir/) - Our local Elixir Meetup, organized with [@tylerpachal](https://medium.com/@tylerpachal) and still going regularly.
* [EmberTO](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Ember-JS-Meetup/) - Our local EmberJS meetup, went on for 8+ year, now dorment.
* [NixTO](https://www.meetup.com/NixToronto/) - A tiny Nix meetup, that is also mostly dorment. [@shazow](https://shazow.net/) is my partner here.
