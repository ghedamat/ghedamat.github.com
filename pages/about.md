Welcome!

This is a space to write a few notes to myself, maybe some of them will be useful to others too.

### Obligatory short bio

<img src="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mattia_thumbnail.jpg" style="padding:0; max-width: 400px" />

I'm an Italian Computer engineer, transplanted in Toronto, Canada.

I love [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), and [Nix(OS)](https://nixos.org/) and I'm interested in most things programming, meditation, hiking and travel.

Currently I work as CTO at [Precision Nutrition](https://precisionnutrition.com), previously I helped run [Unspace](http://unspace.ca/).

**I love meetups**, over the years I have been organizing (with the help of some other amazing folks):

* [EmberTO](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Ember-JS-Meetup/) - Our local EmberJS meetup, has been going on for 8+ year
* [Toronto Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/TorontoElixir/) - Our local Elixir Meetup, organized with [@tylerpachal](https://medium.com/@tylerpachal)
* [NixTO](https://www.meetup.com/NixToronto/) - A tiny Nix meetup, we met once so far but hoping to do more of this soon! [@shazow](https://shazow.net/) is my partner here
